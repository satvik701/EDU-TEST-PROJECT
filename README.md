## Project Title

**Randomized NFT Generator**

## Project Description

The **Randomized NFT Generator** is a decentralized platform designed to create, buy, sell, and auction digital art as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The smart contract allows users to mint unique NFTs with the option of providing specific metadata (like images or data). This contract does not rely on external libraries like OpenZeppelin, instead utilizing native Solidity functionality for managing NFTs.

## Project Vision

The vision behind the **Randomized NFT Generator** is to provide a decentralized and efficient way to create unique digital art NFTs. By making the minting process simple, transparent, and secure, it opens up the possibility for anyone to create, buy, and sell NFTs without relying on centralized platforms. The platform is designed to empower creators while providing a trustworthy marketplace for collectors.

## Future Scope

- **Auction Mechanism**: Implement a feature to auction NFTs, where buyers can place bids and the highest bidder wins the NFT.
- **Randomized NFT Generation**: Introduce a random art generation feature to ensure that each NFT is unique.
- **Secondary Sales Royalties**: Enable royalty payments to artists on every resale of their NFTs.
- **Cross-chain Support**: Extend the platform to support multiple blockchain networks, allowing NFTs to be minted and traded across various chains.
- **Community Governance**: Add governance features allowing the community to vote on new features or upgrades for the platform.

## Key Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint unique NFTs by paying the mint price and providing the URI for the metadata of the NFT.
- **Customizable Minting Price**: The minting price is configurable and can be upd
- ated by the contract owner.
- **Secure Ownership**: The contract ensures that NFTs are owned by specific addresses, with a mapping of each tokenId to its owner.
- **Withdraw Funds**: The contract owner can withdraw accumulated funds from minting fees.
- **Simple Interface**: Basic functionality for minting NFTs and querying token information like ownership and metadata.
